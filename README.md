# Heart-Disorder-Prediction

In this project, we aim to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques with the help of popular Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The dataset is preprocessed and explored using Pandas and Seaborn to gain insights and understand the relationships between features. Key algorithms used include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, K-Means, Decision Tree Classifiers, and XGBoost.

->Data Preprocessing and Visualization: We start by cleaning and normalizing the data using Pandas and NumPy. Visualization techniques using Seaborn and Matplotlib help in understanding feature distributions and correlations.

->Model Implementation:

~Logistic Regression: Applied for its simplicity and interpretability, achieving the highest accuracy among all models.
~K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Tested with various values of 'k' to find the optimal neighbor count.
~Naive Bayes: Utilized for its probabilistic approach and computational efficiency.
~K-Means Clustering: Explored for unsupervised learning to identify natural clusters within the data.
~Decision Tree Classifier: Evaluated for its capability to model complex decision boundaries.
~XGBoost: Used for its robustness and performance in handling large datasets.

->Results and Analysis: After training and testing the models, Logistic Regression emerged as the most accurate model for predicting heart disease. The results from other models are compared and discussed to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
